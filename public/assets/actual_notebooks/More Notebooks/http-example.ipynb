        "body": "# Context\r\n\r\nThe releases demo isn't functioning as expected. Here's a list of its bugs:\r\n1. When typing in the search bar (e.g., \"apple\"), the typed text appears but the releases list doesn’t update accordingly\r\n2. Clicking on an item list tag (release/canary/etc) doesn't show the tag name in the search bar and also doesn't update the releases list.\r\n3. Changing the releases type from Android Studio to Android versions doesn't update the releases list.\r\n4. Additionally, we are missing some Android Studio and Android releases, so this PR also includes updates for those.\r\n\r\nCurrent state of the releases demo showing such bugs:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4935d8e7-a314-48f7-a3d1-d6bb49ee9204\r\n\r\nAlso, I poked a bit in the code and changed the hover animation used in the Android Studio release image to face the user's cursor position. If the user clicks anywhere in the image box, the previous animation runs. This was entirely optional but I thought it'd be fun to update the interactive portion of the image nonetheless. Let me know what you think!\r\n\r\n## Main Changes\r\n\r\n- Updated the `holoFoil` modifier to receive a normalized offset (in other words, a value between -1 and 1 in both axis) instead of a Float\r\n- Created a `FoilInteractionController` class that deals with everything related to the hover effect of the image. It deals with the cursor movement, click and resetting the current running effect once the user stops hovering the image.\r\n  - To make it easier to use it, also created a `rememberFoilInteractionController()` helper function.\r\n- Fixed the releases list not updating by wrapping the `VerticallyScrollableContainer` inside a. `key()` utility composable to force the list to be recomposed every time the service filters the list.\r\n- Fixed the search bar not displaying the tag text clicked by editing the textfield state value every time `filterText` changes\r\n- Added Android 16 SVG + splash screens for both Meerkat and Ladybug AS stable versions.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> I fetched the Android 16 svg directly from [Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Android_16_Developer_Preview_Logo.svg), and [Meerkat](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/android-studio-meerkat-feature-drop-is-stable.html)/[Ladybug](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/01/android-studio-ladybug-feature-drop-is-stable.html) splash screen image from the Android Developers blog. I wasn't able to find their corresponding images for canary/feature drop versions besides some really low quality ones. If you know where to find them, please let me know!\r\n\r\n# Evidences\r\n\r\n## Main Fixes\r\n| Context | Evidence |\r\n|--------|--------|\r\n| Typing in Search Bar | <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2d36418-98d9-4a36-b872-e88667baf42e\" width=\"400\" /> |\r\n| Clicking Item List Tag | <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0886ea3-edf9-40f5-8aa7-e91d44e94f5a\" width=\"400\" /> |\r\n| Changing List Type | <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e938dc30-b69d-4a3e-aad0-596e7d01d9bb\" width=\"400\" /> |\r\n\r\n## Bonus Stuff (?)\r\n| Context | Evidence |\r\n|--------|--------|\r\n| Hovering AS release image | <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/909e069c-9a41-4619-81cb-8eb0a58b1da8\" width=\"400\" /> |\r\n| Clicking on AS release image | <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44d2d988-af9c-4d51-9ac3-2d8c585f19b6\" width=\"400\" /> |\r\n",

This PR makes the necessary changes to show such context menu **for external links only**.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"510\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11a13d7b-3dc5-4ecd-b9d4-27f6521d6fea\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n## Main Changes\r\n- Created a `LabelProvider` interface which both IDE and standalone versions will implement to return the action action label.\r\n- Created a `BridgeUriHandler` class which implements `UriHandler` since in IDE we need to call IntelliJ's `BrowserUtil.browse()` function.\r\n- Created a new `ExternalLink` overload where clicking the element automatically opens the given link and also displays a `ContextMenu`. It also has a new parameter `link` which users can use to specify the actual link from the text.\r\n- This PR also fixes a weird visual bug in the Links row in `SwingComparisonPanel`.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Evidences\r\n\r\n## Right clicking external link\r\n| IDE | Stand-alone |\r\n|--------|--------|\r\n| <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72f26c7e-ad9d-40b6-9eb3-3fb642cf1c27\" width=\"400\" /> | <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6887718f-8946-4c6c-b659-def08d325af5\" width=\"400\" /> |\r\n\r\n## Using a valid browser link\r\n| IDE | Stand-alone |\r\n|--------|--------|\r\n| <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bb538ff-b1f9-4d8f-b548-0d979e1782bb\" width=\"400\" /> | <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/675a12aa-e1c9-4d80-8dc3-3152267d0da5\" width=\"400\" /> |\r\n\r\n## Using an empty string\r\n| IDE | Stand-alone |\r\n|--------|--------|\r\n| <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/241ef34c-4149-408a-9c56-bffb8d38fc9d\" width=\"400\" /> | <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/761b7be2-812c-4c20-af3c-bd624eaaefc9\" width=\"400\" /> |\r\n\r\n## Release notes\r\n\r\n### New features\r\n * `ExternalLink` component now displays a context menu with two default options when right-clicking the link: open in browser and copy link address\r\n",

I'm sure there are Java-DBus interop APIs that could do this more elegantly, but I figured it wasn't worth adding a new dependency for what ends up being a pretty simple check.\r\n\r\n(I also do not typically work in Kotlin; please let me know if there are ways I can improve my formatting or execution here, and I will gladly do so.)",

Included are both light and dark themes which can be optionally light or dark independently from the user's current IDE theme. _(These changes go beyond what is possible simply by using Custom CSS.)_\r\n- Optional GitHub-like syntax coloring inside code fences.\r\n- Greatly improved synchronized scrolling.\r\n- Ability to double-click inside Preview to scroll the Markdown source to a matching position.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n- Using **Tools/Markdown/Export Markdown File To...** can crash and hang IDE if a user chooses to overwrite an existing file. A fix for this is included.\r\n- Fixed attempted dereferences of undefined values in `processLinks.js`.\r\n\r\nKnown issue:\r\n\r\n- Even without my changes, there already existed a bug where sporadically the Markdown Preview comes up blank and must be toggled off and on to refresh it. I hoped to find a solution for this, but couldn't recreate the issue reliably enough to figure out the cause.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ebf5087-0b2c-4e38-8d3a-356f9c7cf77e)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f744ac1d-51ac-45ad-8c55-dad32c9c4fae)\r\n\r\nI've written and published [an IDEA plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14736-ligatures-limited) before, but this is my first try at contributing to the IDEA project itself.\r\n\r\nI suspect that you'll have some feedback for me first for suggested code changes before this can be accepted. I've included a copy of the markdown.jar file with my code changes.\r\n\r\n[markdown.jar.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19998356/markdown.jar.zip)\r\n",

The default value \"Kill the debug process immediately\" = true is the safe choice for individual developers and large teams because:\r\n1. As a developer I need predictability. If I want to stop the program but it will continue to run, then it’s hard to predict what code will be executed and how it affects me and other team members. For example, the application might break shared data such as database, data in the cloud, call other API and corrupt testing data etc.\r\n2. During the debugging session I can modify local variables, skip method calls etc. If the program flow and(or) data were modified but the program continues to run without my consent, then then the behavior might be undefined and it’s hard to guess what the outcome will be. In the worst case it might lead to memory leaks, intensive CPU usage, corrupt local files etc.\r\n3. If I debug and understand that programs will do something wrong (for example, call expensive API or attempt to call a function which will spoil hardware device etc.) then I need a reliable way to stop it and DON’T execute subsequent code.\r\n4. This is the default behavior in other IDEs for Java and other languages.",

When typing in the search bar (e.g., \\\"apple\\\"), the typed text appears but the releases list doesn’t update accordingly\\r\\n2. Clicking on an item list tag (release/canary/etc) doesn't show the tag name in the search bar and also doesn't update the releases list.\\r\\n3. Changing the releases type from Android Studio to Android versions doesn't update the releases list.\\r\\n4. Additionally, we are missing some Android Studio and Android releases, so this PR also includes updates for those.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent state of the releases demo showing such bugs:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4935d8e7-a314-48f7-a3d1-d6bb49ee9204\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, I poked a bit in the code and changed the hover animation used in the Android Studio release image to face the user's cursor position. If the user clicks anywhere in the image box, the previous animation runs. This was entirely optional but I thought it'd be fun to update the interactive portion of the image nonetheless. Let me know what you think!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Main Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n- Updated the `holoFoil` modifier to receive a normalized offset (in other words, a value between -1 and 1 in both axis) instead of a Float\\r\\n- Created a `FoilInteractionController` class that deals with everything related to the hover effect of the image. It deals with the cursor movement, click and resetting the current running effect once the user stops hovering the image.\\r\\n  - To make it easier to use it, also created a `rememberFoilInteractionController()` helper function.\\r\\n- Fixed the releases list not updating by wrapping the `VerticallyScrollableContainer` inside a. `key()` utility composable to force the list to be recomposed every time the service filters the list.\\r\\n- Fixed the search bar not displaying the tag text clicked by editing the textfield state value every time `filterText` changes\\r\\n- Added Android 16 SVG + splash screens for both Meerkat and Ladybug AS stable versions.\\r\\n\\r\\n> [!NOTE]\\r\\n> I fetched the Android 16 svg directly from [Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Android_16_Developer_Preview_Logo.svg), and [Meerkat](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/android-studio-meerkat-feature-drop-is-stable.html)/[Ladybug](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/01/android-studio-ladybug-feature-drop-is-stable.html) splash screen image from the Android Developers blog. I wasn't able to find their corresponding images for canary/feature drop versions besides some really low quality ones. If you know where to find them, please let me know!\\r\\n\\r\\n# Evidences\\r\\n\\r\\n## Main Fixes\\r\\n| Context | Evidence |\\r\\n|--------|--------|\\r\\n| Typing in Search Bar | <video src=\\\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2d36418-98d9-4a36-b872-e88667baf42e\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" /> |\\r\\n| Clicking Item List Tag | <video src=\\\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0886ea3-edf9-40f5-8aa7-e91d44e94f5a\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" /> |\\r\\n| Changing List Type | <video src=\\\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e938dc30-b69d-4a3e-aad0-596e7d01d9bb\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" /> |\\r\\n\\r\\n## Bonus Stuff (?)\\r\\n| Context | Evidence |\\r\\n|--------|--------|\\r\\n| Hovering AS release image | <video src=\\\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/909e069c-9a41-4619-81cb-8eb0a58b1da8\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" /> |\\r\\n| Clicking on AS release image | <video src=\\\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44d2d988-af9c-4d51-9ac3-2d8c585f19b6\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" /> |\\r\\n\",\n",

Included are both light and dark themes which can be optionally light or dark independently from the user's current IDE theme. _(These changes go beyond what is possible simply by using Custom CSS.)_\\r\\n- Optional GitHub-like syntax coloring inside code fences.\\r\\n- Greatly improved synchronized scrolling.\\r\\n- Ability to double-click inside Preview to scroll the Markdown source to a matching position.\\r\\n\\r\\nBug fixes:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Using **Tools/Markdown/Export Markdown File To...** can crash and hang IDE if a user chooses to overwrite an existing file. A fix for this is included.\\r\\n- Fixed attempted dereferences of undefined values in `processLinks.js`.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnown issue:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Even without my changes, there already existed a bug where sporadically the Markdown Preview comes up blank and must be toggled off and on to refresh it. I hoped to find a solution for this, but couldn't recreate the issue reliably enough to figure out the cause.\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ebf5087-0b2c-4e38-8d3a-356f9c7cf77e)\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f744ac1d-51ac-45ad-8c55-dad32c9c4fae)\\r\\n\\r\\nI've written and published [an IDEA plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14736-ligatures-limited) before, but this is my first try at contributing to the IDEA project itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suspect that you'll have some feedback for me first for suggested code changes before this can be accepted.

The default value \\\"Kill the debug process immediately\\\" = true is the safe choice for individual developers and large teams because:\\r\\n1. As a developer I need predictability. If I want to stop the program but it will continue to run, then it’s hard to predict what code will be executed and how it affects me and other team members. For example, the application might break shared data such as database, data in the cloud, call other API and corrupt testing data etc.\\r\\n2. During the debugging session I can modify local variables, skip method calls etc. If the program flow and(or) data were modified but the program continues to run without my consent, then then the behavior might be undefined and it’s hard to guess what the outcome will be. In the worst case it might lead to memory leaks, intensive CPU usage, corrupt local files etc.\\r\\n3. If I debug and understand that programs will do something wrong (for example, call expensive API or attempt to call a function which will spoil hardware device etc.) then I need a reliable way to stop it and DON’T execute subsequent code.\\r\\n4. This is the default behavior in other IDEs for Java and other languages.\",\n",

expected. Here's a list of its bugs:\\r\\n1. When typing in the search bar (e.g., \\\"apple\\\"), the typed text appears but the releases list doesn’t update accordingly\\r\\n2. Clicking on an item list tag (release/canary/etc) doesn't show the tag name in the search bar and also doesn't update the releases list.\\r\\n3. Changing the releases type from Android Studio to Android versions doesn't update the releases list.\\r\\n4. Additionally, we are missing some Android Studio and Android releases, so this PR also includes updates for those.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent state of the releases demo showing such bugs:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4935d8e7-a314-48f7-a3d1-d6bb49ee9204\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, I poked a bit in the code and changed the hover animation used in the Android Studio release image to face the user's cursor position. If the user clicks anywhere in the image box, the previous animation runs. This was entirely optional but I thought it'd be fun to update the interactive portion of the image nonetheless. Let me know what you think!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Main Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n- Updated the `holoFoil` modifier to receive a normalized offset (in other words, a value between -1 and 1 in both axis) instead of a Float\\r\\n- Created a `FoilInteractionController` class that deals with everything related to the hover effect of the image. It deals with the cursor movement, click and resetting the current running effect once the user stops hovering the image.\\r\\n  - To make it easier to use it, also created a `rememberFoilInteractionController()` helper function.\\r\\n- Fixed the releases list not updating by wrapping the `VerticallyScrollableContainer` inside a. `key()` utility composable to force the list to be recomposed every time the service filters the list.\\r\\n- Fixed the search bar not displaying the tag text clicked by editing the textfield state value every time `filterText` changes\\r\\n- Added Android 16 SVG + splash screens for both Meerkat and Ladybug AS stable versions.\\r\\n\\r\\n> [!NOTE]\\r\\n> I fetched the Android 16 svg directly from [Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Android_16_Developer_Preview_Logo.svg), and [Meerkat](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/android-studio-meerkat-feature-drop-is-stable.html)/[Ladybug](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/01/android-studio-ladybug-feature-drop-is-stable.html) splash screen image from the Android Developers blog. I wasn't able to find their corresponding images for canary/feature drop versions besides some really low quality ones. If you know where to find them, please let me know!\\r\\n\\r\\n# Evidences\\r\\n\\r\\n## Main Fixes\\r\\n| Context | Evidence |\\r\\n|--------|--------|\\r\\n| Typing in Search Bar | <video

elements of the gradle project classpath (including plugins and gradle itself, as well as provide native support for sources if those exist)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Changes:\\r\\n- Support for properly handling a configure block in typing suggestions\\r\\n- Properly order the extensions and the configure block\\r\\n- Abstract away how individual extension providers provider their Psi meta information of what extensions are available\\r\\n- Provide an extension contributor which can provide Psi meta information of extensions which are not on the root, but at least one level in\\r\\n- Provide support for browsing and navigating in `NamedDomainObjectCollection`, however there are some restrictions when it comes to property mode vs configuration mode, see the comment in `GradleNamedDomainCollectionContributor`\\r\\n- Rework the project extension provider to use the new abstract extension system\\r\\n- Expose the required information from the Gradle plugin.\\r\\n\\r\\n## TODO:\\r\\n- [x] Potentially work on tests, I tried writing several but the current testing setup does not suit it very much, and this area of the code seems poorly to not covered.\\r\\n- [x] Further research UX improvements that can be made to provide a better experience. \",\n        \"closed_by\": null,\n        \"reactions\": {\n            \"url\":

for a very close match to how Markdown will appear on GitHub. Included are both light and dark themes which can be optionally light or dark independently from the user's current IDE theme. _(These changes go beyond what is possible simply by using Custom CSS.)_\\r\\n- Optional GitHub-like syntax coloring inside code fences.\\r\\n- Greatly improved synchronized scrolling.\\r\\n- Ability to double-click inside Preview to scroll the Markdown source to a matching position.\\r\\n\\r\\nBug fixes:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Using **Tools/Markdown/Export Markdown File To...** can crash and hang IDE if a user chooses to overwrite an existing file. A fix for this is included.\\r\\n- Fixed attempted dereferences of undefined values in `processLinks.js`.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnown issue:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Even without my changes, there already existed a bug where sporadically the Markdown Preview comes up blank and must be toggled off and on to refresh it. I hoped to find a solution for this, but couldn't recreate the issue reliably enough to figure out the cause.\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ebf5087-0b2c-4e38-8d3a-356f9c7cf77e)\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f744ac1d-51ac-45ad-8c55-dad32c9c4fae)\\r\\n\\r\\nI've written and published [an IDEA plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14736-ligatures-limited) before, but this is my first try at contributing to the IDEA project itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suspect that you'll have some feedback for me first for suggested code changes before this can be accepted.

The default value \\\"Kill the debug process immediately\\\" = true is the safe choice for individual developers and large teams because:\\r\\n1. As a developer I need predictability. If I want to stop the program but it will continue to run, then it’s hard to predict what code will be executed and how it affects me and other team members. For example, the application might break shared data such as database, data in the cloud, call other API and corrupt testing data etc.\\r\\n2. During the debugging session I can modify local variables, skip method calls etc. If the program flow and(or) data were modified but the program continues to run without my consent, then then the behavior might be undefined and it’s hard to guess what the outcome will be. In the worst case it might lead to memory leaks, intensive CPU usage, corrupt local files etc.\\r\\n3. If I debug and understand that programs will do something wrong (for example, call expensive API or attempt to call a function which will spoil hardware device etc.) then I need a reliable way to stop it and DON’T execute subsequent code.\\r\\n4.

        "body": "# Context\r\n\r\nThe releases demo isn't functioning as expected. Here's a list of its bugs:\r\n1. When typing in the search bar (e.g., \"apple\"), the typed text appears but the releases list doesn’t update accordingly\r\n2. Clicking on an item list tag (release/canary/etc) doesn't show the tag name in the search bar and also doesn't update the releases list.\r\n3. Changing the releases type from Android Studio to Android versions doesn't update the releases list.\r\n4. Additionally, we are missing some Android Studio and Android releases, so this PR also includes updates for those.\r\n\r\nCurrent state of the releases demo showing such bugs:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4935d8e7-a314-48f7-a3d1-d6bb49ee9204\r\n\r\nAlso, I poked a bit in the code and changed the hover animation used in the Android Studio release image to face the user's cursor position. If the user clicks anywhere in the image box, the previous animation runs. This was entirely optional but I thought it'd be fun to update the interactive portion of the image nonetheless. Let me know what you think!\r\n\r\n## Main Changes\r\n\r\n- Updated the `holoFoil` modifier to receive a normalized offset (in other words, a value between -1 and 1 in both axis) instead of a Float\r\n- Created a `FoilInteractionController` class that deals with everything related to the hover effect of the image. It deals with the cursor movement, click and resetting the current running effect once the user stops hovering the image.\r\n  - To make it easier to use it, also created a `rememberFoilInteractionController()` helper function.\r\n- Fixed the releases list not updating by wrapping the `VerticallyScrollableContainer` inside a. `key()` utility composable to force the list to be recomposed every time the service filters the list.\r\n- Fixed the search bar not displaying the tag text clicked by editing the textfield state value every time `filterText` changes\r\n- Added Android 16 SVG + splash screens for both Meerkat and Ladybug AS stable versions.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> I fetched the Android 16 svg directly from [Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Android_16_Developer_Preview_Logo.svg), and [Meerkat](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/android-studio-meerkat-feature-drop-is-stable.html)/[Ladybug](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/01/android-studio-ladybug-feature-drop-is-stable.html) splash screen image from the Android Developers blog. I wasn't able to find their corresponding images for canary/feature drop versions besides some really low quality ones. If you know where to find them, please let me know!\r\n\r\n# Evidences\r\n\r\n## Main Fixes\r\n| Context | Evidence |\r\n|--------|--------|\r\n| Typing in Search Bar | <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2d36418-98d9-4a36-b872-e88667baf42e\" width=\"400\" /> |\r\n| Clicking Item List Tag | <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0886ea3-edf9-40f5-8aa7-e91d44e94f5a\" width=\"400\" /> |\r\n| Changing List Type | <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e938dc30-b69d-4a3e-aad0-596e7d01d9bb\" width=\"400\" /> |\r\n\r\n## Bonus Stuff (?)\r\n| Context | Evidence |\r\n|--------|--------|\r\n| Hovering AS release image | <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/909e069c-9a41-4619-81cb-8eb0a58b1da8\" width=\"400\" /> |\r\n| Clicking on AS release image | <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44d2d988-af9c-4d51-9ac3-2d8c585f19b6\" width=\"400\" /> |\r\n",

This PR makes the necessary changes to show such context menu **for external links only**.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"510\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11a13d7b-3dc5-4ecd-b9d4-27f6521d6fea\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n## Main Changes\r\n- Created a `LabelProvider` interface which both IDE and standalone versions will implement to return the action action label.\r\n- Created a `BridgeUriHandler` class which implements `UriHandler` since in IDE we need to call IntelliJ's `BrowserUtil.browse()` function.\r\n- Created a new `ExternalLink` overload where clicking the element automatically opens the given link and also displays a `ContextMenu`. It also has a new parameter `link` which users can use to specify the actual link from the text.\r\n- This PR also fixes a weird visual bug in the Links row in `SwingComparisonPanel`.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Evidences\r\n\r\n## Right clicking external link\r\n| IDE | Stand-alone |\r\n|--------|--------|\r\n| <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72f26c7e-ad9d-40b6-9eb3-3fb642cf1c27\" width=\"400\" /> | <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6887718f-8946-4c6c-b659-def08d325af5\" width=\"400\" /> |\r\n\r\n## Using a valid browser link\r\n| IDE | Stand-alone |\r\n|--------|--------|\r\n| <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bb538ff-b1f9-4d8f-b548-0d979e1782bb\" width=\"400\" /> | <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/675a12aa-e1c9-4d80-8dc3-3152267d0da5\" width=\"400\" /> |\r\n\r\n## Using an empty string\r\n| IDE | Stand-alone |\r\n|--------|--------|\r\n| <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/241ef34c-4149-408a-9c56-bffb8d38fc9d\" width=\"400\" /> | <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/761b7be2-812c-4c20-af3c-bd624eaaefc9\" width=\"400\" /> |\r\n\r\n## Release notes\r\n\r\n### New features\r\n * `ExternalLink` component now displays a context menu with two default options when right-clicking the link: open in browser and copy link address\r\n",

I'm sure there are Java-DBus interop APIs that could do this more elegantly, but I figured it wasn't worth adding a new dependency for what ends up being a pretty simple check.\r\n\r\n(I also do not typically work in Kotlin; please let me know if there are ways I can improve my formatting or execution here, and I will gladly do so.)",

Included are both light and dark themes which can be optionally light or dark independently from the user's current IDE theme. _(These changes go beyond what is possible simply by using Custom CSS.)_\r\n- Optional GitHub-like syntax coloring inside code fences.\r\n- Greatly improved synchronized scrolling.\r\n- Ability to double-click inside Preview to scroll the Markdown source to a matching position.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n- Using **Tools/Markdown/Export Markdown File To...** can crash and hang IDE if a user chooses to overwrite an existing file. A fix for this is included.\r\n- Fixed attempted dereferences of undefined values in `processLinks.js`.\r\n\r\nKnown issue:\r\n\r\n- Even without my changes, there already existed a bug where sporadically the Markdown Preview comes up blank and must be toggled off and on to refresh it. I hoped to find a solution for this, but couldn't recreate the issue reliably enough to figure out the cause.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ebf5087-0b2c-4e38-8d3a-356f9c7cf77e)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f744ac1d-51ac-45ad-8c55-dad32c9c4fae)\r\n\r\nI've written and published [an IDEA plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14736-ligatures-limited) before, but this is my first try at contributing to the IDEA project itself.\r\n\r\nI suspect that you'll have some feedback for me first for suggested code changes before this can be accepted. I've included a copy of the markdown.jar file with my code changes.\r\n\r\n[markdown.jar.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19998356/markdown.jar.zip)\r\n",

The default value \"Kill the debug process immediately\" = true is the safe choice for individual developers and large teams because:\r\n1. As a developer I need predictability. If I want to stop the program but it will continue to run, then it’s hard to predict what code will be executed and how it affects me and other team members. For example, the application might break shared data such as database, data in the cloud, call other API and corrupt testing data etc.\r\n2. During the debugging session I can modify local variables, skip method calls etc. If the program flow and(or) data were modified but the program continues to run without my consent, then then the behavior might be undefined and it’s hard to guess what the outcome will be. In the worst case it might lead to memory leaks, intensive CPU usage, corrupt local files etc.\r\n3. If I debug and understand that programs will do something wrong (for example, call expensive API or attempt to call a function which will spoil hardware device etc.) then I need a reliable way to stop it and DON’T execute subsequent code.\r\n4. This is the default behavior in other IDEs for Java and other languages.",

When typing in the search bar (e.g., \\\"apple\\\"), the typed text appears but the releases list doesn’t update accordingly\\r\\n2. Clicking on an item list tag (release/canary/etc) doesn't show the tag name in the search bar and also doesn't update the releases list.\\r\\n3. Changing the releases type from Android Studio to Android versions doesn't update the releases list.\\r\\n4. Additionally, we are missing some Android Studio and Android releases, so this PR also includes updates for those.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent state of the releases demo showing such bugs:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4935d8e7-a314-48f7-a3d1-d6bb49ee9204\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, I poked a bit in the code and changed the hover animation used in the Android Studio release image to face the user's cursor position. If the user clicks anywhere in the image box, the previous animation runs. This was entirely optional but I thought it'd be fun to update the interactive portion of the image nonetheless. Let me know what you think!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Main Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n- Updated the `holoFoil` modifier to receive a normalized offset (in other words, a value between -1 and 1 in both axis) instead of a Float\\r\\n- Created a `FoilInteractionController` class that deals with everything related to the hover effect of the image. It deals with the cursor movement, click and resetting the current running effect once the user stops hovering the image.\\r\\n  - To make it easier to use it, also created a `rememberFoilInteractionController()` helper function.\\r\\n- Fixed the releases list not updating by wrapping the `VerticallyScrollableContainer` inside a. `key()` utility composable to force the list to be recomposed every time the service filters the list.\\r\\n- Fixed the search bar not displaying the tag text clicked by editing the textfield state value every time `filterText` changes\\r\\n- Added Android 16 SVG + splash screens for both Meerkat and Ladybug AS stable versions.\\r\\n\\r\\n> [!NOTE]\\r\\n> I fetched the Android 16 svg directly from [Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Android_16_Developer_Preview_Logo.svg), and [Meerkat](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/android-studio-meerkat-feature-drop-is-stable.html)/[Ladybug](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/01/android-studio-ladybug-feature-drop-is-stable.html) splash screen image from the Android Developers blog. I wasn't able to find their corresponding images for canary/feature drop versions besides some really low quality ones. If you know where to find them, please let me know!\\r\\n\\r\\n# Evidences\\r\\n\\r\\n## Main Fixes\\r\\n| Context | Evidence |\\r\\n|--------|--------|\\r\\n| Typing in Search Bar | <video src=\\\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2d36418-98d9-4a36-b872-e88667baf42e\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" /> |\\r\\n| Clicking Item List Tag | <video src=\\\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0886ea3-edf9-40f5-8aa7-e91d44e94f5a\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" /> |\\r\\n| Changing List Type | <video src=\\\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e938dc30-b69d-4a3e-aad0-596e7d01d9bb\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" /> |\\r\\n\\r\\n## Bonus Stuff (?)\\r\\n| Context | Evidence |\\r\\n|--------|--------|\\r\\n| Hovering AS release image | <video src=\\\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/909e069c-9a41-4619-81cb-8eb0a58b1da8\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" /> |\\r\\n| Clicking on AS release image | <video src=\\\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44d2d988-af9c-4d51-9ac3-2d8c585f19b6\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" /> |\\r\\n\",\n",

Included are both light and dark themes which can be optionally light or dark independently from the user's current IDE theme. _(These changes go beyond what is possible simply by using Custom CSS.)_\\r\\n- Optional GitHub-like syntax coloring inside code fences.\\r\\n- Greatly improved synchronized scrolling.\\r\\n- Ability to double-click inside Preview to scroll the Markdown source to a matching position.\\r\\n\\r\\nBug fixes:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Using **Tools/Markdown/Export Markdown File To...** can crash and hang IDE if a user chooses to overwrite an existing file. A fix for this is included.\\r\\n- Fixed attempted dereferences of undefined values in `processLinks.js`.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnown issue:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Even without my changes, there already existed a bug where sporadically the Markdown Preview comes up blank and must be toggled off and on to refresh it. I hoped to find a solution for this, but couldn't recreate the issue reliably enough to figure out the cause.\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ebf5087-0b2c-4e38-8d3a-356f9c7cf77e)\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f744ac1d-51ac-45ad-8c55-dad32c9c4fae)\\r\\n\\r\\nI've written and published [an IDEA plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14736-ligatures-limited) before, but this is my first try at contributing to the IDEA project itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suspect that you'll have some feedback for me first for suggested code changes before this can be accepted.

The default value \\\"Kill the debug process immediately\\\" = true is the safe choice for individual developers and large teams because:\\r\\n1. As a developer I need predictability. If I want to stop the program but it will continue to run, then it’s hard to predict what code will be executed and how it affects me and other team members. For example, the application might break shared data such as database, data in the cloud, call other API and corrupt testing data etc.\\r\\n2. During the debugging session I can modify local variables, skip method calls etc. If the program flow and(or) data were modified but the program continues to run without my consent, then then the behavior might be undefined and it’s hard to guess what the outcome will be. In the worst case it might lead to memory leaks, intensive CPU usage, corrupt local files etc.\\r\\n3. If I debug and understand that programs will do something wrong (for example, call expensive API or attempt to call a function which will spoil hardware device etc.) then I need a reliable way to stop it and DON’T execute subsequent code.\\r\\n4. This is the default behavior in other IDEs for Java and other languages.\",\n",

expected. Here's a list of its bugs:\\r\\n1. When typing in the search bar (e.g., \\\"apple\\\"), the typed text appears but the releases list doesn’t update accordingly\\r\\n2. Clicking on an item list tag (release/canary/etc) doesn't show the tag name in the search bar and also doesn't update the releases list.\\r\\n3. Changing the releases type from Android Studio to Android versions doesn't update the releases list.\\r\\n4. Additionally, we are missing some Android Studio and Android releases, so this PR also includes updates for those.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent state of the releases demo showing such bugs:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4935d8e7-a314-48f7-a3d1-d6bb49ee9204\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, I poked a bit in the code and changed the hover animation used in the Android Studio release image to face the user's cursor position. If the user clicks anywhere in the image box, the previous animation runs. This was entirely optional but I thought it'd be fun to update the interactive portion of the image nonetheless. Let me know what you think!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Main Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n- Updated the `holoFoil` modifier to receive a normalized offset (in other words, a value between -1 and 1 in both axis) instead of a Float\\r\\n- Created a `FoilInteractionController` class that deals with everything related to the hover effect of the image. It deals with the cursor movement, click and resetting the current running effect once the user stops hovering the image.\\r\\n  - To make it easier to use it, also created a `rememberFoilInteractionController()` helper function.\\r\\n- Fixed the releases list not updating by wrapping the `VerticallyScrollableContainer` inside a. `key()` utility composable to force the list to be recomposed every time the service filters the list.\\r\\n- Fixed the search bar not displaying the tag text clicked by editing the textfield state value every time `filterText` changes\\r\\n- Added Android 16 SVG + splash screens for both Meerkat and Ladybug AS stable versions.\\r\\n\\r\\n> [!NOTE]\\r\\n> I fetched the Android 16 svg directly from [Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Android_16_Developer_Preview_Logo.svg), and [Meerkat](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/android-studio-meerkat-feature-drop-is-stable.html)/[Ladybug](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/01/android-studio-ladybug-feature-drop-is-stable.html) splash screen image from the Android Developers blog. I wasn't able to find their corresponding images for canary/feature drop versions besides some really low quality ones.

a configure block in typing suggestions\\r\\n- Properly order the extensions and the configure block\\r\\n- Abstract away how individual extension providers provider their Psi meta information of what extensions are available\\r\\n- Provide an extension contributor which can provide Psi meta information of extensions which are not on the root, but at least one level in\\r\\n- Provide support for browsing and navigating in `NamedDomainObjectCollection`, however there are some restrictions when it comes to property mode vs configuration mode, see the comment in `GradleNamedDomainCollectionContributor`\\r\\n- Rework the project extension provider to use the new abstract extension system\\r\\n- Expose the required information from the Gradle plugin.\\r\\n\\r\\n## TODO:\\r\\n- [x] Potentially work on tests, I tried writing several but the current testing setup does not suit it very much, and this area of the code seems poorly to not

Platform](https://platform.jetbrains.com/t/poststartupactivity-is-working-in-development-environment-but-not-after-deployment/1515/7) forum._\\r\\n\\r\\nEnhancements:\\r\\n\\r\\n- GitHub style options for a very close match to how Markdown will appear on GitHub. Included are both light and dark themes which can be optionally light or dark independently from the user's current IDE theme. _(These changes go beyond what is possible simply by using Custom CSS.)_\\r\\n- Optional GitHub-like syntax coloring inside code fences.\\r\\n- Greatly improved synchronized scrolling.\\r\\n- Ability to double-click inside Preview to scroll the Markdown source to a matching position.\\r\\n\\r\\nBug fixes:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Using **Tools/Markdown/Export Markdown File To...** can crash and hang IDE if a user chooses to overwrite an existing file.

The default value \\\"Kill the debug process immediately\\\" = true is the safe choice for individual developers and large teams because:\\r\\n1. As a developer I need predictability. If I want to stop the program but it will continue to run, then it’s hard to predict what code will be executed and how it affects me and other team members. For example, the application might break shared data such as database, data in the cloud, call other API and corrupt testing data etc.\\r\\n2. During the debugging session I can modify local variables, skip method calls etc. If the program flow and(or) data were modified but the program continues to run without my consent, then then the behavior might be undefined and it’s hard to guess what the outcome will be. In the worst case it might lead to memory leaks, intensive CPU usage, corrupt local files etc.\\r\\n3. If I debug and understand that programs will do something wrong (for example, call expensive API or attempt to call a function which will spoil hardware device etc.) then I need a reliable way to stop it and DON’T execute subsequent code.\\r\\n4.

`CHECK_DIRECTORY`](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/0e71313b43b3880db8a7334ab9f29cb8db4864ed/plugins/gradle/java/src/service/project/wizard/GradleNewProjectWizardStep.kt#L196-L199) in addition, which also checks whether the directory is writable, even though this is never needed here:\\r\\nhttps://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/0e71313b43b3880db8a7334ab9f29cb8db4864ed/platform/platform-impl/src/com/intellij/openapi/ui/validation/validations.kt#L39-L46\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a consequence, users that use a package manager first have to create their projects with gradlew, then manually delete the gradlew files and change the installation home in the tool window instead of just creating their project.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis PR fixes this by providing a variant of `CHECK_DIRECTORY` that does not check for writeability.\",\n        \"closed_by\": null,\n        \"reactions\":

Here&amp;#39;s a list of its bugs:&bsol;r&bsol;n1. When typing in the search bar (e.g., &amp;#34;apple&amp;#34;), the typed text appears but the releases list doesn&amp;#8217;t update accordingly&bsol;r&bsol;n2. Clicking on an item list tag (release&sol;canary&sol;etc) doesn&amp;#39;t show the tag name in the search bar and also doesn&amp;#39;t update the releases list.&bsol;r&bsol;n3. Changing the releases type from Android Studio to Android versions doesn&amp;#39;t update the releases list.&bsol;r&bsol;n4. Additionally, we are missing some Android Studio and Android releases, so this PR also includes updates for those.&bsol;r&bsol;n&bsol;r&bsol;nCurrent state of the releases demo showing such bugs:&bsol;r&bsol;n&bsol;r&bsol;nhttps:&sol;&sol;github.com&sol;user-attachments&sol;assets&sol;4935d8e7-a314-48f7-a3d1-d6bb49ee9204&bsol;r&bsol;n&bsol;r&bsol;nAlso, I poked a bit in the code and changed the hover animation used in the Android Studio release image to face the user&amp;#39;s cursor position. If the user clicks anywhere in the image box, the previous animation runs. This was entirely optional but I thought it&amp;#39;d be fun to update the interactive portion of the image nonetheless. Let me know what you think!&bsol;r&bsol;n&bsol;r&bsol;n## Main Changes&bsol;r&bsol;n&bsol;r&bsol;n- Updated the `holoFoil` modifier to receive a normalized offset (in other words, a value between -1 and 1 in both axis) instead of a Float&bsol;r&bsol;n- Created a `FoilInteractionController` class that deals with everything related to the hover effect of the image. It deals with the cursor movement, click and resetting the current running effect once the user stops hovering the image.&bsol;r&bsol;n  - To make it easier to use it, also created a `rememberFoilInteractionController()` helper function.&bsol;r&bsol;n- Fixed the releases list not updating by wrapping the `VerticallyScrollableContainer` inside a. `key()` utility composable to force the list to be recomposed every time the service filters the list.&bsol;r&bsol;n- Fixed the search bar not displaying the tag text clicked by editing the textfield state value every time `filterText` changes&bsol;r&bsol;n- Added Android 16 SVG + splash screens for both Meerkat and Ladybug AS stable versions.&bsol;r&bsol;n&bsol;r&bsol;n&amp;#62; [!NOTE]&bsol;r&bsol;n&amp;#62; I fetched the Android 16 svg directly from [Wikipedia](https:&sol;&sol;upload.wikimedia.org&sol;wikipedia&sol;commons&sol;9&sol;92&sol;Android_16_Developer_Preview_Logo.svg), and [Meerkat](https:&sol;&sol;android-developers.googleblog.com&sol;2025&sol;05&sol;android-studio-meerkat-feature-drop-is-stable.html)&sol;[Ladybug](https:&sol;&sol;android-developers.googleblog.com&sol;2025&sol;01&sol;android-studio-ladybug-feature-drop-is-stable.html) splash screen image from the Android Developers blog.

The default value &amp;#34;Kill the debug process immediately&amp;#34; = true is the safe choice for individual developers and large teams because:&bsol;r&bsol;n1. As a developer I need predictability. If I want to stop the program but it will continue to run, then it&amp;#8217;s hard to predict what code will be executed and how it affects me and other team members. For example, the application might break shared data such as database, data in the cloud, call other API and corrupt testing data etc.&bsol;r&bsol;n2. During the debugging session I can modify local variables, skip method calls etc. If the program flow and(or) data were modified but the program continues to run without my consent, then then the behavior might be undefined and it&amp;#8217;s hard to guess what the outcome will be. In the worst case it might lead to memory leaks, intensive CPU usage, corrupt local files etc.&bsol;r&bsol;n3. If I debug and understand that programs will do something wrong (for example, call expensive API or attempt to call a function which will spoil hardware device etc.) then I need a reliable way to stop it and DON&amp;#8217;T execute subsequent code.&bsol;r&bsol;n4.

Context\\r\\n\\r\\nThe releases demo isn't functioning as expected. Here's a list of its bugs:\\r\\n1. When typing in the search bar (e.g., \\\"apple\\\"), the typed text appears but the releases list doesn’t update accordingly\\r\\n2. Clicking on an item list tag (release/canary/etc) doesn't show the tag name in the search bar and also doesn't update the releases list.\\r\\n3. Changing the releases type from Android Studio to Android versions doesn't update the releases list.\\r\\n4. Additionally, we are missing some Android Studio and Android releases, so this PR also includes updates for those.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent state of the releases demo showing such bugs:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4935d8e7-a314-48f7-a3d1-d6bb49ee9204\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, I poked a bit in the code and changed the hover animation used in the Android Studio release image to face the user's cursor position. If the user clicks anywhere in the image box, the previous animation runs. This was entirely optional but I thought it'd be fun to update the interactive portion of the image nonetheless. Let me know what you think!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Main Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n- Updated the `holoFoil` modifier to receive a normalized offset (in other words, a value between -1 and 1 in both axis) instead of a Float\\r\\n- Created a `FoilInteractionController` class that deals with everything related to the hover effect of the image. It deals with the cursor movement, click and resetting the current running effect once the user stops hovering the image.\\r\\n  - To make it easier to use it, also created a `rememberFoilInteractionController()` helper function.\\r\\n- Fixed the releases list not updating by wrapping the `VerticallyScrollableContainer` inside a. `key()` utility composable to force the list to be recomposed every time the service filters the list.\\r\\n- Fixed the search bar not displaying the tag text clicked by editing the textfield state value every time `filterText` changes\\r\\n- Added Android 16 SVG + splash screens for both Meerkat and Ladybug AS stable versions.\\r\\n\\r\\n> [!NOTE]\\r\\n> I fetched the Android 16 svg directly from [Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Android_16_Developer_Preview_Logo.svg), and [Meerkat](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/android-studio-meerkat-feature-drop-is-stable.html)/[Ladybug](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/01/android-studio-ladybug-feature-drop-is-stable.html) splash screen image from the Android Developers blog. I wasn't able to find their corresponding images for canary/feature drop versions besides some really low quality ones.

TLDR:\\r\\n- Handle gradle extensions natively, both in navigational actions, as well as during typing previews\\r\\n- Introduce support for navigating to all kinds of elements of the gradle project classpath (including plugins and gradle itself, as well as provide native support for sources if those exist)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Changes:\\r\\n- Support for properly handling a configure block in typing suggestions\\r\\n- Properly order the extensions and the configure block\\r\\n- Abstract away how individual extension providers provider their Psi meta information of what extensions are available\\r\\n- Provide an extension contributor which can provide Psi meta information of extensions which are not on the root, but at least one level in\\r\\n- Provide support for browsing and navigating in `NamedDomainObjectCollection`, however there are some restrictions when it comes to property mode vs configuration mode, see the comment in `GradleNamedDomainCollectionContributor`\\r\\n- Rework the project extension provider to use the new abstract extension system\\r\\n- Expose the required information from the Gradle

A fix for this is included.\\r\\n- Fixed attempted dereferences of undefined values in `processLinks.js`.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnown issue:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Even without my changes, there already existed a bug where sporadically the Markdown Preview comes up blank and must be toggled off and on to refresh it. I hoped to find a solution for this, but couldn't recreate the issue reliably enough to figure out the cause.\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ebf5087-0b2c-4e38-8d3a-356f9c7cf77e)\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f744ac1d-51ac-45ad-8c55-dad32c9c4fae)\\r\\n\\r\\nI've written and published [an IDEA plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14736-ligatures-limited) before, but this is my first try at contributing to the IDEA project itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suspect that you'll have some feedback for me first for suggested code changes before this can be accepted.

to resolve https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-164593. The default value \\\"Kill the debug process immediately\\\" = true is the safe choice for individual developers and large teams because:\\r\\n1. As a developer I need predictability. If I want to stop the program but it will continue to run, then it’s hard to predict what code will be executed and how it affects me and other team members. For example, the application might break shared data such as database, data in the cloud, call other API and corrupt testing data etc.\\r\\n2. During the debugging session I can modify local variables, skip method calls etc. If the program flow and(or) data were modified but the program continues to run without my consent, then then the behavior might be undefined and it’s hard to guess what the outcome will be. In the worst case it might lead to memory leaks, intensive CPU usage, corrupt local files etc.\\r\\n3. If I debug and understand that programs will do something wrong (for example, call expensive API or attempt to call a function which will spoil hardware device etc.) then I need a reliable way to stop it and DON’T execute subsequent code.\\r\\n4.
