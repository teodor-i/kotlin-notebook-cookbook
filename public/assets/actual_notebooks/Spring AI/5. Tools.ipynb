    "# Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool calling is the ability of a model to determine when to call an external function and structure data for this call.\n",
    "Essentially, it creates a bridge between the text capabilities of LLMs and external tools or APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works**:\n",
    "1. The model identifies when a user request requires using a tool\n",
    "2. The LLM transforms the necessary parameters into JSON or another structured format\n",
    "3. The external system executes the tool with the received parameters\n",
    "4. The tool execution results are returned to the model, which incorporates them into its response\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach expands LLM capabilities both in obtaining data and performing actions in specific systems.\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "you can write a function that retrieves current weather information,\n",
    "allowing the LLM to provide clothing recommendations.\n",
    "Or you could provide tools for interacting with SQL databases,\n",
    "enabling natural language queries that execute the necessary SQL commands behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add our dependencies,\n",
    "API key,\n",
    "and define a `ChatClient` as we did in previous notebooks."

       "   - Mix cooked pasta with a tomato sauce, add cheese (like mozzarella or ricotta), and bake until bubbly and golden.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Pasta Salad**: \n",
