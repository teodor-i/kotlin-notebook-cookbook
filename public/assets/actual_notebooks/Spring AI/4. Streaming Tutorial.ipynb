    "# Streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming is a capability that allows AI providers to deliver responses as tokens are generated in real-time,\n",
    "rather than waiting for the complete response to be finished.\n",
    "You can visualize it as filling a bucket with water — streaming lets you watch the water level rising in real-time,\n",
    "instead of placing the bucket somewhere, walking away, and only returning once it's completely full.\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming significantly improves the user experience,\n",
    "as people can immediately see the response forming rather than staring at a loading indicator.\n",
    "This is especially valuable since synchronous requests can take quite a long time to generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement streaming responses with Kotlin and Spring AI.\n",
    "For this, we'll need to add dependencies.\n",
    "In addition to `spring-ai-openai`, we'll need the Kotlin coroutines library to work with `Flow`."

Realizing the importance of humility, Benny promised to train harder and respect his fellow creatures' strengths. From that day on, he and Timmy became the best of friends, often racing together but always encouraging one another. \n",

One sunny morning, Ruby decided to gather her friends — Benny the brave bunny, and Lily the wise old tortoise — to embark on an adventure. As they hopped along the winding path, they stumbled upon a sparkling stream filled with shimmering fish that danced like stars in the water. \n",

The trio encountered magical creatures along the way, including a singing bird with feathers of gold and a gentle deer who offered them guidance. \n",

Beneath the tree, they discovered a chest filled with sparkling gemstones and enchanted carrots that could grant wishes. Ruby, Benny, and Lily decided to share their newfound treasure with all the animals of the meadow, ensuring that everyone could enjoy the magic. \n",

And so, Ruby and her friends continued to explore, their hearts forever filled with the spirit of adventure and the joy of togetherness."
