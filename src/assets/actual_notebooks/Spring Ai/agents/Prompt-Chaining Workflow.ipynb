    "# Prompt Chaining Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore the prompt chaining workflow.\n",
    "Using Kotlin and Claude via the LangChain4j library,\n",
    "we'll implement a practical example that demonstrates how to break down complex tasks into manageable steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is prompt chaining?\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt chaining is a technique where we decompose a complex task into a sequence of simpler steps.\n",
    "Each step involves an LLM call that processes the output from the previous step.\n",
    "This creates a _\"chain\"_ of prompts that collectively solve the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Prompt Chaining Workflow Diagram](image/prompt_chaining.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key benefits:\n",
    "- By focusing on smaller tasks, improved accuracy\n",
    "- Each step is controlled and verified\n",
    "- Using different prompts is optimized for different tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use prompt chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "Common use cases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Content generation followed by translation\n",
    "- Creating outlines before drafting full documents\n",
    "- Data extraction and transformation processes\n",
